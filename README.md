# Angular-Bootstrap
Atom Snippets for [UI Bootstrap](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap) (Bootstrap components for AngularJS). Should work together nicely with the packages [angularjs](https://atom.io/packages/angularjs) and [atom-bootstrap3](https://atom.io/packages/atom-bootstrap3).

# How to use

In any HTML file simply start typing `uib-`. Depending on your configuration of the autocomplete-plus package you'll see auto-completions and you can insert the snippets via pressing enter and/or tab.

# Contribute

If you encounter an error or just want to improve the package, just open an [issue](https://github.com/herrherrmann/angular-bootstrap/issues) or directly create a pull request! When adding snippets, please make sure to use senseful examples (that's usually a mix of the official [Angular UI Bootstrap Reference](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap) and the [Bootstrap Reference](http://getbootstrap.com/)).
